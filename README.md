Hey guys, since I failed to use Sqlite3 with C programming langusage, and also it's so tough for me to use MySQL database system with C that I changed my plan to use Java creating my project for the ADDRESSBOOK application. Iâ€™ve successfully implemented some functions in my source files today, and pushed up to my github repository. Hope I can handle of the stuff later!
